I would like to acknowledge my sincere appreciation to all those who have contributed to the successful completion of this project. I am deeply grateful for the guidance, assistance and encouragement I have received from the people close to me throughout these months.

First and foremost, my supervisor, \textbf{Dimitrios Papadopoulos} (\href{mailto:dimp@dtu.dk}{dimp@dtu.dk}). His experience and knowledge in computer vision have been invaluable, and his excellent feedback has allowed me to improve myself as a professional in AI and the quality of the present thesis.

My parents have been a fundamental pillar in my life, providing unwavering support as I pursue my dreams. They share in my happiness as if it were their own, and their encouragement has been a constant source of strength for me.

Nor can I forget all the people who have accompanied me throughout the long hours spent in the library and made them joyful. Luana, Alex, Shenhav, Konstantinos, Natalie, Heleri, and many more have made the hours fly by.

Finally, I would like to make a special mention to all the people who love me, my chosen family, who from Madrid and Barcelona have brought warmth to my heart.
